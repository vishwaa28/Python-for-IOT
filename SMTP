Here is a Python program using the smtplib module to send an email via SMTP:

SMTP Email Sending Program

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

# Email configuration
SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'  # Replace with your SMTP server
SMTP_PORT = 587
EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'your_email@gmail.com'  # Replace with your email address
EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_password'  # Replace with your app password or email password

# Function to send email
def send_email(to_email, subject, message):
    try:
        # Create a MIMEText message
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
        msg['From'] = EMAIL_ADDRESS
        msg['To'] = to_email
        msg['Subject'] = subject

        # Add message body
        msg.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))

        # Connect to the SMTP server
        with smtplib.SMTP(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT) as server:
            server.starttls()  # Start TLS encryption
            server.login(EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD)
            server.sendmail(EMAIL_ADDRESS, to_email, msg.as_string())
            print("Email sent successfully!")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending email: {e}")

# Replace these values with your desired recipient, subject, and message
recipient_email = 'recipient_email@gmail.com'  # Replace with recipient email
email_subject = 'Test Email'
email_message = 'Hello, this is a test email sent from Python!'

# Call the function to send email
send_email(recipient_email, email_subject, email_message)

Steps to Run the Program:

1. Replace your_email@gmail.com and your_password with your email and password.

For Gmail users: Enable "Allow less secure apps" or generate an App Password.



2. Replace recipient_email@gmail.com with the recipient's email address.


3. Save the script and run it.



Notes:

If you're using Gmail, you might need to enable less secure app access or use an App Password.

Ensure you use TLS (Transport Layer Security) for secure communication.
